# Weather-Dashboard
Challenge 6 in the Coding bootcamp

## Description
This challenge had us utilize an OpenWeather API in order to make an app that displays the current weather as well as a 5 day forecast when the user enters a specific city. Search history is appended to the page and is interactive.
